## Overview

A puppet-lint plugin to check you are not using top scope fact variables like
`$::operatingsystem`. You should use the $facts hash like
`$facts['operatingsystem']` instead.

This linter will not convert from the legacy facts like
`$facts['operatingsystem']` to `$facts['os']['name']`. The [legacy
facts](https://github.com/mmckinst/puppet-lint-legacy_facts-check) linter can be
used to accomplish that.

In puppet 2.x facts were top scope variables and accessed as `$operatingsystem`
or `$::operatingsystem`, the
[latter being far more common](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/3.8/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars.html#historical-note-about-)
especially because the
[linter enforces that convention](http://puppet-lint.com/checks/variable_scope/).

Puppet 3.5 added a `$facts` hash to access facts like
`$facts['operatingsystem']`. This works if you set `trusted_node_data = true`
but it was
[not enabled by default](https://github.com/puppetlabs/docs-archive/blob/master/puppet/3.5/release_notes.markdown#global-facts-hash). Puppet
4 has it enabled by default.

This puppet-lint plugin will help find facts referenced as top scope variables
and replace them with the `$facts` hash to improve readability of code. Its only
useful if you're running puppet 3.5 to 3.8 with trusted_node_data enabled, or if
you're running puppet 4.

## Limitations

* It only finds facts using the top-scope: ie it will find `$::operatingsystem`
  but not `$operatingsystem`.
* It assumes all top scope variables are facts. If you have top scope variables
  that aren't facts you should configure the
  [linter to ignore them](https://github.com/mmckinst/puppet-lint-top_scope_facts-check#configuring-the-check).


## Installing

### From the command line

```shell
$ gem install puppet-lint-top_scope_facts-check
```

### In a Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'puppet-lint-top_scope_facts-check', :require => false
```

## Checks

#### What you have done

```puppet
$service_name = $::operatingsystem {
  'CentOS' => 'httpd',
  'Debian' => 'apache2',
}
```

#### What you should have done

```puppet
$service_name = $facts['operatingsystem'] {
  'CentOS' => 'httpd',
  'Debian' => 'apache2',
}
```

#### Configuring the check

You can whitelist top scope variables to ignore via the Rake task. You should
insert the following line to your `Rakefile`.

```ruby
PuppetLint.configuration.top_scope_variables = ['location', 'role']
```

#### Disabling the check

To disable this check, you can add `--no-top_scope_facts` to your puppet-lint
command line.

```shell
$ puppet-lint --no-top_scope_facts path/to/file.pp
```

Alternatively, if youâ€™re calling puppet-lint via the Rake task, you should
insert the following line to your `Rakefile`.

```ruby
PuppetLint.configuration.send('disable_top_scope_facts')
```
Alternatively, you can disable it directly in your puppet manifest.

```puppet
# lint:ignore:top_scope_facts
$service_name = $::operatingsystem {
  'CentOS' => 'httpd',
  'Debian' => 'apache2',
}
# lint:endignore
```
